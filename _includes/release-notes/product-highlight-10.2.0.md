* Introduced the capability for users to influence the image processing process by altering intermediate results. Users can now clone, edit, and substitute intermediate result units within the callback function of each type. Subsequent operations will then proceed based on the updated unit.
* Introduced a feature for multi-condition filtering across products. Users can now specify filtering criteria for the task results of a `TargetROIDef` by implementing an `OutputTaskSetting` based on the task results of varying products from descendant `TargetROIDef` objects.
* Enhanced the `Offset` parameter in `TargetROIDef`. Users now have the capability to meticulously customize components of the coordinate system, including the origin, X-axis, and Y-axis, for precise offset calculation.
