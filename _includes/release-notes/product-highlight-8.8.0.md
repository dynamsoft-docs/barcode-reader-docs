- Added a new localization mode `ONED_FAST_SCAN`, which significantly improved the localization speed for 1D barcodes.
- Added the ability to specify barcode width, height, angle to improve the recognition speed if you have advance information about barcodes.
- Optimized the logic of confidence scoring for 2D barcodes. The 2D barcode results with confidence greater than 30 are more accurate.
