## Sometimes the Barcode Reader SDK returns incorrect results with four or less characters. How do you avoid that?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

One way to avoid this is to set the [minBarcodeTextLength](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/programming/c-cplusplus/struct/PublicRuntimeSettings.html?src=cpp&&ver=latest#minbarcodetextlength) to the correct length that the barcode results should be. Say that the barcode results should at least be 10 characters long, and the results are sometimes coming out with just 6 or 7 characters. By setting the minBarcodeTextLength to 10, the SDK will ignore results that are shorter than 10 characters.
