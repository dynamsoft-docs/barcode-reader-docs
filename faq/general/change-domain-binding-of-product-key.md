 > Please note that a single project can contain multiple license items. If you wish to bind a single license item to a certain domain, then you will need to make sure that license item is the only item in the associated project. First, remove the license item from its current project. Afterwards, create a new project and then open its configuration page. Then, move the license item to the new project and finally edit the binding info of the new project.
