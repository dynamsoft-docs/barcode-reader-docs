## How does your SDK compare to other commercial SDKs?

The Dynamsoft Barcode Reader offers some of the best performance metrics out of all of the SDKs in the industry. Throughout the years, our SDK has proven to meet any and every requirement there is on the spectrum, whether that is amazingly fast results in an interactive video scenario, or wildly accurate results when decoding DPM codes on warehouse machinery. The Dynamsoft Barcode Reader is tried and true, and has been utilized throughout various industries with utmost satisfaction.

We invite you to watch this [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrQ4_PImRQ8) on German Red Cross case study to learn of how our SDK is being used in healthcare.

DBR is able to work in a multitude of usage scenarios and industries where our competitors cannot. Instead of talking about all these various use cases, we would like to share some videos that showcase them:

- [**Digitizing your Healthcare Organization using DBR**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zmjeZINjIA)
- [**Driver License Scanner using DBR**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EOkf8cFtOU)
- [**COVID-19 Vaccine Passport Scanner**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdRRsqho-vk)
- [**Creating a Warehouse Management System with DBR**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCyzcV0ofMk)

These are some of the most popular use cases that we have come across, but there's much more that our SDK can accomplish, most of which are mentioned [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/introduction/overview.html?ver=latest#user-scenarios).

Unlike most of our competitors, the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader comes in a variety of flavours, whether you are looking to build a desktop application, a native mobile application, or a web application. DBR supports a multitude of languages, including C, .NET, Java, Swift, JavaScript, and many more that our competitors do not support. In addition, DBR also supports a variety of the major frameworks that are used to create applications, such as Xamarin, Cordova, React, and a handful more. No matter the programming language or framework that you want to use for your application, Dynamsoft has got you covered. Feel free to check out the following videos that explore the different editions the SDK offers.

Another clear advantage that our SDK has over some of the other commercial SDKs, is its customizability and flexibility to suit a multitude of usage scenarios and conditions. Our SDK offers a spectrum of performance metrics: Do you want extremely accurate results while sacrificing speed? DBR has you covered. Is your application going to be used in a high-paced environment? DBR can certainly meet those speed requirements. Or maybe you are looking to have the best of both worlds, both very fast and very accurate results. DBR can certainly be configured to achieve this.

Throughout the years, we developed DBR to deal with sub-optimal environmental conditions that we noticed other SDKs are not able to handle. Some of the most common conditions include wrinkled/damaged barcodes, low lighting, or barcodes at an irregular orientation. By supporting such conditions, we ensure that DBR is able to handle barcode scanning not only under ideal conditions, but also under not-so-ideal conditions which is common to see when you're out in the field or working in a warehouse.

Please explore the following videos that address these topics:
