## How to get a free trial of the SDK? How many days does the free trial allow? Can I extend my trial if I need more time? If so, how?

To get a free trial of the SDK, please download it from [our website](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/downloads/).

The main way to get the trial license is via the [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?utm_source=faq&product=dbr) through which you can extend your trial license once your original expires. The trial can be extended twice, for 15 days each, and a total of 30 days.
