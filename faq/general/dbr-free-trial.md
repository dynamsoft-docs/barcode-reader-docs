## What I need to know about trial licenses?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

To get a free trial of the SDK, please download it from [our website](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/downloads/).

The main way to get the trial license is via the [Request a Trial License](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dbr&utm_source=docs){:target="_blank"} link through which you can extend your trial license once your original expires. The trial can be extended twice, for 15 days each, and a total of 30 days.
