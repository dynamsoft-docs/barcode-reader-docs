## Can Barcode Reader SDK read PDF files? Do I need to pay for this feature?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader does indeed support reading barcodes from PDF files (see [Features](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/features/#Decode-Barcodes)). The only exception is the JavaScript and Mobile editions currently.

No extra license is required to read from PDF files.
