## Does the SDK support reading barcodes from PDF files? Is an additional license required for this functionality?

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader does indeed support reading barcodes from PDF files (see [Features](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/features/#Decode-Barcodes)). The only exception is the JavaScript edition currently.

No extra license is required to read from PDF files.
