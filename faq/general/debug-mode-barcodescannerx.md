# How to use Debug Mode in Barcode Scanner X?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)


## Debug Mode in BarcodeScannerX

If you are experiencing app crashes in your own application or you’ve come across some barcode(s) that you can’t read and you have exhausted all of the other troubleshooting methods, Debug Mode of the [BarcodeScannerX](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/sdk-mobile/#appDemo) demo app can help offer one last effort to resolve these issues.

This next section will explain how to toggle on debug mode on the demo app, and will then dive into how to collect crash logs and/or image samples.

1. From the home screen, go to Advanced Scan.

2. After Crash Logger is toggled on, please go ahead and scan codes until you reproduce the crash issue.

3. After the app crashes, re-open BarcodeScannerX app and go to Advanced Scan -> settings. Tap the "Share" button to share the log files with the [Dynamsoft support team](https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/?ver=latest).

If you are having trouble reading barcodes, you should use the Image Cropper to capture some sample image(s) or frame(s) and send them to the Dynamsoft Support Team:

1. Toggle on Image Cropper
