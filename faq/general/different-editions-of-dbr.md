## Which edition of Barcode Reader should I use?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

The edition of the SDK depends on the application environment/type, which is one of: a desktop app, native mobile app, web app (server-side), or web app (client-side).

- desktop app: Windows/Linux edition
- desktop app (embedded â€“ e.g. raspberry pi): Windows/Linux edition
- native mobile app: iOS/Android edition
- webapp (server-side): Windows/Linux edition
- webapp (client-side): JavaScript edition

> Note - It is important to note the difference the Windows/Linux edition and the JavaScript edition when it comes to web applications. The Windows/Linux edition can only operate on the server-side, so it cannot offer live video decoding, while the JavaScript edition can since it is client-side.
