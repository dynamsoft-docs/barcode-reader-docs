## How to expand the quota of a runtime license?

The quota of a runtime license can indeed be expanded before the expiration of the license. This can be done in a couple of ways.

- By accessing the license page in the [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/fullLicense), under the `Manage License` operation, one of the options include `Add Quota`. This leads the user to a checkout page confirming the extra quantity that they want to add (by default they will be adding the same quantity that they originally bought, which can be multiplied by the `Quantity` number. After confirming the customer details and payment info, the order will be processed for the quota expansion.

- You can contact the [Dynamsoft support team](https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact/) and ask for a quote for this expansion. The quote can then be paid by the customer in order to get processed right away. Alternatively, the customer can send the team a signed PO based on this quote, and the order will be processed and the unpaid invoice sent to the customer for payment.
