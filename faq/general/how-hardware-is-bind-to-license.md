## What I need to know about licensing process?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

- When devices are registered, they get a UUID that is generated based on some hardware and OS info. The exact breakdown of what is collected when using the mobile edition or server/desktop edition is mentioned [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-server/docs/about/terms.html#generate-a-uuid).
- Should the user change the OS (upgrade/downgrade), then the same device will take up a new license since the UUID that is generated for the device after the change will be different.
