# What are the pros and cons of using the CDN?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

**Pros**:

- No need for server configuration since your server is not hosting the library.
- Integrating the library into your app using the CDN would only take a minute compared to hosting it yourself.

**Cons**:

- No control over the availability of the source files should the CDN servers go down.
- Requires an external connection to the CDN servers to download the library.
