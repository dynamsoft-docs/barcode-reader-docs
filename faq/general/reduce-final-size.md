# Can I reduce the size of the final Android app?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

It is recommended that you distribute your app usingâ€¯App Bundle in order to reduce the final size of the Android app.

The second step is to utilize APK splits. To learn more about this, please refer to this [page](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits#configure-abi-split).

The third thing to do is to remove processor architecture support. If you won't be distributing your app via Google Play, please refer to this [page](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis#gc) on how to proceed with this step.
