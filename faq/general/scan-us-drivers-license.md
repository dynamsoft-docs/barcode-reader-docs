## How to scan barcodes on US Driver's Licenses and extract the information?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

- [JavaScript edition (most popular use case)](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/dbr-browser-samples/blob/master/4.use-case/2.read-a-drivers-license.html)
- [iOS sample](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-mobile-samples/tree/v9.6.20/ios/Swift/Usecase/ReadADriversLicenseSwift/)
- [Android sample](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-mobile-samples/tree/v9.6.20/android/Java/Usecase/ReadADriversLicense/)
