# How to import the settings of Barcode Scanner X app into my app?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)


In the Barcode Scanner X app, please go to the use case scenario that you are interested. On the right-bottom, tap on "Export Template". 

Once you get the templates, you can implement them using the [`initRuntimeSettingsWithString`](../api-reference/primary-parameter-and-runtime-settings-advanced.md#initruntimesettingswithstring) or [`initRuntimeSettingsWithFile`](../api-reference/primary-parameter-and-runtime-settings-advanced.md#initruntimesettingswithfile) methods, depending on which input method you prefer.
