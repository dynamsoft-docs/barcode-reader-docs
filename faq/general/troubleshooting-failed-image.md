[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

If the barcode is not recognized by Dynamsoft Barcode Reader, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/?ver=latest" target="_blank">Dynamsoft support team</a>.

Alternatively, here is the general troubleshooting steps:

1. Please ensure the lighting is not very bright or very dim.
2. Please ensure the aimming barcode format has been checked on.(Advanced Scan -> settings -> Barcode Format -> check the barcode formats)
3. We can decrease the Confidence level to increase the read rate.(Advanced Scan -> settings -> Result Settings -> Set Confidence Level to 10)
4. We can increase the deblur level to increase the read rate.(Advanced Scan -> settings -> Additional Settings -> increase DeblurLevel)
