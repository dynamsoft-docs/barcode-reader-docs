## What will happen if licenses are not renewed in time?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

Your users will be met with a message saying that the license has expired when they try to use the application that has the Barcode Reader SDK integrated. In order to renew the license immediately, you can do so via the [customer portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/fullLicense) or by contacting the [Dynamsoft Support Team](https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/).
