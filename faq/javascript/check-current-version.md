## How to check the version of the JS SDK I am currently using?

There are multiple ways to check the version currently being used -

- The first way is to use the [version API](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/programming/javascript/api-reference/InitializationControl.html?ver=latest#version). Using this API in the browser console should print out the version of the library being used by the web app.
- If you are using the library via npm or yarn, then you can check the version of the package via

    ```javascript
    npm â€“v dynamsoft-javascript-barcode
    ```

- If you are including the library via the CDN link, then the version number should be mentioned in that reference link.
