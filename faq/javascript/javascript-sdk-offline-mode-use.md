## How to use the JavaScript SDK in offline mode?

The client device can work in an offline scenario after it is registered, but no more than 7 days. The initial registration of the device requires an internet connection if the license is hosted on the Dynamsoft server. If you chose the self-hosting option when activating the license, then the device must have a connection to your internally hosted license server for the initial registration.

The full details are explained [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-server/docs/about/licensefaq.html?ver=latest#can-a-client-device-work-offline).
