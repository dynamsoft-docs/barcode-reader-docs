## Why are newline characters not being rendered when displaying the barcode results in a textbox?

That is because in normal HTML, newline characters are not interpreted as they normally would, so newline characters in the barcode result will be ignored. To account for them, itâ€™s best to either wrap the element used to display the result in a `<pre>` element, or manually replace each newline character with `<br />`. Please refer to [this article](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/programming/javascript/user-guide/?ver=latest#accounting-for-newline-characters-in-the-barcode-result) for more details.
