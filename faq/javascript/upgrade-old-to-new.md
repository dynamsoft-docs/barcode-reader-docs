## How to upgrade from an old to new version?

- If you are performing a **major upgrade** by upgrading from one major version to another (7.x -> 8.x), the primary contact of the license must get in touch with Dynamsoft Support by sending an email to [support@dynamsoft.com](mailto:support@dynamsoft.com) and request to upgrade their valid annual license. If you own several licenses, please specify if all or a specific subset needs to be upgraded. Once the request is received, the upgrade is processed within one business day.

- If you would like to do a **minor upgrade** (8.0 -> 8.1.1) then there is no need to send an email for an upgrade as the license doesnâ€™t need to be upgraded between minor versions. All you need to do is simply reference the newer version or download a copy of the new version.

> Please also make sure to note these [changes](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/programming/javascript/upgrade-guide/?ver=latest) between the versions.
