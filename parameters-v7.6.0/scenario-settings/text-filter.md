# How to filter text in an image

When trying to read an image where a barcode is surrounded by a large number of irrelevant characters, the presence of these words may lead to incorrect positioning, and slow down the execution speed of `DBR`. `DBR` handles such scenarios by utilizing the built-in [`TextFilterModes`]({{ site.parameters_reference }}text-filter-modes.html#textfiltermodes). 

Let us consider the following image

![text filter sample][1]

For this image, we can set [`TextFilterModes`]({{ site.parameters_reference }}text-filter-modes.html#textfiltermodes) to `TFM_GENERAL_CONTOUR` and observe through the intermediate result, `IRT_TEXT_ZONE`. For easier demonstration purposes, we have merged the result of the `IRT_TEXT_ZONE` onto the binarized result. As it shown in the following images, the algorithm has recognized almost all the characters.

Next, these words are excluded, and we are left with the optimized image as shown below

![binary img after text filter][4]

The process of text filtering will not be performed when using the positioning methods `LM_CONNECTED_BLOCKS` and `LM_SCAN_DIRECTLY`. Therefore, if DBR only performs `LM_CONNECTED_BLOCKS` and `LM_SCAN_DIRECTLY` positioning, the intermediate result `IRT_TEXT_ZONE` will be empty data.

## Sample Template

```json
{
	"Version":"3.0",
	"ImageParameterContentArray":[
	{
		"NAME":"Test1",
		"BarcodeFormatIds":["BF_ALL"],
		"LocalizationModes":["LM_LINES"],
		"TextFilterModes":[
			{
				"Mode":"TFM_GENERAL_CONTOUR"
			}
		]
	}
	]
}
```
