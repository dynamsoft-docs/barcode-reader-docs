Your previous SDK license for version 7.x is not compatible with the version 8.x. Please [contact us](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Company/Contact.aspx) to upgrade your license.

In v8.0.0, we introduced a new license tracking mechanism, <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/license-server/docs/about/index.html" target="_blank">License 2.0</a>. If you wish to use License 2.0, please refer to [this article](../../license-activation/set-full-license.md) to set the license.
