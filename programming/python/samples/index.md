# Samples and Demos - Python Edition


## Samples

| Sample Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/hello-world.py" target="_blank">hello-world</a> | This sample demonstrates the simplest way to read barcodes from an image file and output barcode format and text. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/general-settings.py" target="_blank">general-settings</a> | This sample demonstrates how to configure general used settings and read barcodes from an image file. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/image-decoding.py" target="_blank">image-decoding</a> | This sample demonstrates how to decode images in various format (including Disk File/File Bytes in Memory/Raw Buffer/Base64 String/Bitmap) when using Dynamsoft Barcode Reader. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/video-decoding.py" target="_blank">video-decoding</a> | This is a python sample that illustrates how to decode video from a file or camera when using Dynamsoft Barcode Reader. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/video-decoding-for-picamera.py" target="_blank">video-decoding-for-picamera</a> | This is a python sample that illustrates how to decode videos from PiCamera in the Raspberry Pi when using Dynamsoft Barcode Reader. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/performance/batch-decode.py" target="_blank">batch-decode</a> | This is a python sample that shows how to decode image files in a specified folder. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/performance/speed-first-settings.py" target="_blank">speed-first-settings</a> | This sample demonstrates how to configure Dynamsoft Barcode Reader to read barcodes as fast as possible. The downside is that read-rate and accuracy might be affected. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/performance/read-rate-first-settings.py" target="_blank">read-rate-first-settings</a> | This sample demonstrates how to configure Dynamsoft Barcode Reader to read as many barcodes as possible at one time. The downside is that speed and accuracy might be affected. It is recommended to apply these configurations when decoding multiple barcodes from a single image. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/performance/accuracy-first-settings.py" target="_blank">accuracy-first-settings</a> | This sample demonstrates how to configure Dynamsoft Barcode Reader to read barcodes as accurately as possible. The downside is that speed and read-rate might be affected. It is recommended to apply these configurations when misreading is unbearable. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-python-samples/blob/master/samples/use-case/read-dpm-barcode.py" target="_blank">read-dpm-barcode</a> | This is a python sample that shows how to configure Dynamsoft Barcode Reader to read DPM barcodes. |
