- Greatly improved recognition rate for barcodes on grid background.
- Optimized localization for PDF417 without enough quiet zone.

#### NEW RESOURCES

#### FIXED

- Small fixes and tweaks.

### 6.1.0

#### NEW

- Added GetTemplateSettings and SetTemplateSettings methods which allow you to review and adjust barcode reading settings at runtime.

#### IMPROVED

- Improved localization algorithm for barcodes rotated in a degree or with poor perspective.
- Faster read speed for QR, Data Matrix and PDF417 barcodes.

### 6.0.0

#### NEW

- Easy and flexible to create a custom barcode reading template for your specific use case.

#### IMPROVED

### 5.2.0

#### IMPROVED

- Improved the localization and recognition algorithms for PDF417 barcodes.
- Optimized the de-blur algorithm for 1D barcodes to improve the recognition accuracy.
- Optimized the timeout support. Now it is possible to stop barcode recognition by timeout.
- Increased QR Code and DataMatrix barcode recognition speed for B&W images.

#### FIXED

- Small fixes and tweaks.

### 5.1.0

#### FIXED

- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect result points if de-blur algorithm is used when reading 1D barcodes.
- Other small fixes and tweaks.

### 5.0.0

#### NEW

- New de-blur algorithm for 1D barcodes to improve the accuracy when scanning linear barcodes from out-of-focus, blurred images.
- New multi-thread processing to improve the scanning accuracy and speed of 1D and PDF417 barcodes.
- Added new APIs that enable you to specify page numbers, barcode regions, barcode width, barcode height, barcode module size and barcode angles for barcode detection. These greatly improve the decoding workflow and barcode reading efficiency.
- Added ImageCaptureDevice API to set the capture device (scanner, camera or fax) being used to scan barcode images. When set, it will use a better and more appropriate image processing technique to the images captured from that device.
- Added TimeoutPerPage API to set the maximum amount of time for reading barcodes on one page.
- Added BarcodeColorMode API to set the ink color for barcodes searching.
- Added BarcodeTextEncoding API to set barcode text encoding mode so that you can display special characters properly.
- Added ReturnUnrecognizedBarcode API to set whether to return unrecognized barcodes.
- Added LoadSetting API so that you can now load the settings to be used in recognizing barcodes from a JSON string.
- Added Angle API to set the angle ranges of barcodes for scanning.
- Added Angle property to return the rotation angle of a detected barcode.

#### IMPROVED

- Combined C and C++ header files into one to simplify the reference of the header file.

#### FIXED

- Fixed an issue where the DLL crashes when reading DataMatrix in multiple threads.
- Other small fixes and tweaks.
